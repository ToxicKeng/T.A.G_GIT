    he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Yeah, let\u2019s shake
    it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink,
    takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He
    squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle,

    a sound, and next thing I knew...wham-o!.\u201D Barry drives up, stops in front
    of Adam. Adam jumps in. BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry\u2019s
    hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It\u2019s a special day. Finally graduating.
    ADAM I never thought I\u2019d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school,
    three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college.
    I\u2019m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the
    hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who\u2019s jogging.
    ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks
    good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you
    hear about Frankie? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM
    You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I\u2019m not going to his funeral. Everybody
    knows you sting someone you die, you don\u2019t waste it on a squirrel. He was
    such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could\u2019ve just gotten out of the way.
    The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM
    I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY
    I guess that\u2019s why they say we don\u2019t need vacations. CUT TO: SEQ. 95

    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 5. ADAM We are. BARRY Bee-men. ADAM Amen! BARRY Hallelujah.
    Barry hits Adam\u2019s forehead. Adam goes into the rapture. An announcement
    comes over the PA. ANNOUNCER (V.O) Students, faculty, distinguished bees...please
    welcome, Dean Buzzwell. ANGLE ON: DEAN BUZZWELL steps up to the podium. The podium
    has a sign that reads: \u201CWelcome Graduating Class of:\u201D, with train-station
    style flipping numbers after it. BUZZWELL Welcome New Hive City graduating class
    of... The numbers on the podium change to 9:15. BUZZWELL (CONT\u2019D) ...9:15.
    (he clears his throat) And that concludes our graduation ceremonies. And begins
    your career at Honex Industries. BARRY Are we going to pick our job today? ADAM
    I heard it\u2019s just orientation. The rows of chairs change in transformer-like
    mechanical motion to Universal Studios type tour trams. Buzzwell walks off stage.
    BARRY (re: trams) Whoa, heads up! Here we go. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07

    A little scary. Barry shakes Adam. BARRY AND ADAM AAHHHH! The tram passes under
    SIGNS READING: \u201CHonex: A Division of Honesco: A Part of the Hexagon Group.\u201D
    TRUDY Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco, and a part of the Hexagon group.
    BARRY This is it! The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONT\u2019D)
    Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to
    the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant
    pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically
    color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this... Trudy GRABS
    a TEST TUBE OF HONEY from a technician. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07
    7. TRUDY (CONT\u2019D) ...soothing, sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow,
    you all know as... EVERYONE ON THE TRAM (in unison) H-o-n-e-y. Trudy flips the
    flask into the crowd, and laughs as they all scramble for it. ANGLE ON: A GIRL
    BEE catching the honey. ADAM (sotto) That girl was hot. BARRY (sotto) She\u2019s
    my cousin. ADAM She is? BARRY Yes, we\u2019re all cousins. ADAM Right. You\u2019re
    right. TRUDY At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee
    existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. ANGLE ON: A
    STUNT BEE in a HELMET getting hit with a NEWSPAPER, then a SHOE, then a FLYSWATTER.
    He gets up, and gives a \u201Cthumb\u2019s up\u201D. The graduate bees APPLAUD.
    ADAM (re: stunt bee) What do you think he makes? BARRY Not enough. TRUDY And
    here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS
    8/13/07 8. BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of
    honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman
    machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips
    of honey. Adam\u2019s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY
    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job,
    if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations.
    But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the
    rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s smile dropping slightly.
    BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\u2019t know that. ADAM What\u2019s
    the difference? TRUDY And you\u2019ll be happy to know that bees as a species
    haven\u2019t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you\u2019ll just work
    us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We\u2019ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry.
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type
    steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes

    DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - \u201CWALKING THE HIVE\u201D INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON:
    The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY
    (annoyed) \u201CWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201D Adam, how could you say that?
    One job forever? That\u2019s an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, I\u2019m
    relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how
    could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything?
    We\u2019re bees. We\u2019re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
    They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: \u201CBee Goes

    NEWSPAPER BEE (to the bee guzzling gas) Hey! Barry and Adam begin to cross the
    street. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 10. BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you
    ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in
    the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like
    what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I don\u2019t know. But you know

    approach. BARRY Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, hey, those are Pollen jocks.
    ADAM Wow. FOUR PATROL BEES FLY in through the hive\u2019s giant Gothic entrance.
    The Patrol Bees are wearing fighter pilot helmets with black visors. ADAM (CONT\u2019D)
    I\u2019ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it\u2019s like to
    go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don\u2019t come back. \"Bee
    Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed
    from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD
    forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar.
    Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You\u2019re
    monsters. You\u2019re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping
    up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been?
    ADAM I don\u2019t know. BARRY Their day\u2019s not planned. Outside the hive,
    flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can\u2019t just decide
    one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen
    Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto
    Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than
    you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s
    just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps,
    unless you\u2019re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two
    girl bees. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren\u2019t
    they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON
    Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let\u2019s have some
    fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to
    the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah,
    one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat,
    and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1
    Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\u2019d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what
    were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
    The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can
    autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON
    Little gusty out there today, wasn\u2019t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ
    You know, we\u2019re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here
    tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It\u2019s a puddle-jump
    for us. But maybe you\u2019re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering
    louder) You are not! BUZZ We\u2019re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re:
    j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy?
    Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred
    means. CUT TO: SEQ. 450 - \u201CTHE BALCONY\u201D \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS
    8/13/07 14. INT. BENSON HOUSE BALCONY - LATER Barry is standing on the balcony
    alone, looking out over the city. Martin Benson ENTERS, sneaks up behind Barry
    and gooses him in his ribs. MARTIN BENSON Honex! BARRY Oh, Dad. You surprised
    me. MARTIN BENSON (laughing) Have you decided what you\u2019re interested in,
    Son? BARRY Well, there\u2019s a lot of choices. MARTIN BENSON But you only get
    one. Martin LAUGHS. BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every
    day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring. (making the
    stirring motion) You grab that stick and you just move it around, and you stir
    it around. You get yourself into a rhythm, it\u2019s a beautiful thing. BARRY
    You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\u2019t

    That\u2019s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS

    important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our

    whatever they want from us cause we\u2019re the little guys. And what I\u2019m

    He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don\u2019t!
    It\u2019s what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery

    I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery.
    MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled

    - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus
    the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their
    legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A
    NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry
    stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is
    on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a
    BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing
    the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS
    8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re
    alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam
    THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM
    (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from
    downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it.
    BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was
    all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM
    You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right
    into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs
    in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY
    I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t

    window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t
    smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it!
    That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s

    and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where
    is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor,
    it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and
    as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard
    a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these
    ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery
    rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with
    wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd
    shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their
    charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.
    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am
    afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case.
    MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun.
    Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking
    gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams
    the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY
    It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This
    harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
    He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT.
    The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury,
    look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\"
    Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines
    in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the
    white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table.
    The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do?
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the
    species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench.
    It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees!
    ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of
    the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up
    for a \u201Chigh 5\u201D. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could
    do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table.
    He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay.
    Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong
    to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery
    approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to
    Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the
    balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer
    in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face.

    Be careful. Barry flies up to the cockpit door. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS
    A female flight attendant, ANGELA, is in the cockpit with the pilots. \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 111. There\u2019s a KNOCK at the door. BARRY (C.O) Hey,
    can I get some help with this Sky Mall Magazine? I\u2019d like to order the talking
    inflatable travel pool filter. ANGELA (to the pilots, irritated) Excuse me. CUT
    TO: EXT. CABIN - CONTINUOUS Angela opens the cockpit door and looks around. She
    doesn\u2019t see anybody. ANGLE ON: Barry hidden on the yellow and black \u201Ccaution\u201D
    stripe. As Angela looks around, Barry zips into the cockpit. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT
    BARRY Excuse me, Captain. I am in a real situation here... PILOT (pulling an
    earphone back, to the co-pilot) What did you say, Hal? CO-PILOT I didn\u2019t
    say anything. PILOT (he sees Barry) Ahhh! Bee! BARRY No, no! Don\u2019t freak
    out! There\u2019s a chance my entire species-- CO-PILOT (taking off his earphones)
    Ahhh! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 112. The pilot grabs a \u201CDUSTBUSTER\u201D
    vacuum cleaner. He aims it around trying to vacuum up Barry. The co-pilot faces
    camera, as the pilot tries to suck Barry up. Barry is on the other side of the
    co-pilot. As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still
    attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee
    comes off the co-pilot\u2019s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs
    across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I\u2019m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who\u2019s
    an attorney? PILOT Don\u2019t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and
    mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot\u2019s nose, and knocks
    out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button.
    The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold.
    Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE CABIN Vanessa
    studies her laptop, looking serious. SFX: PA CRACKLE. BARRY (V.O) (in captain
    voice) Good afternoon passengers, this is your captain speaking. Would a Miss
    Vanessa Bloome in 24F please report to the cockpit. And please hurry! \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 113. ANGLE ON: The aisle, and Vanessa head popping up.
    CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA What happened here? BARRY I tried
    to talk to them, but then there was a Dustbuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded...Now
    one\u2019s bald, one\u2019s in a boat, and they\u2019re both unconscious. VANESSA
    Is that another bee joke? BARRY No. No one\u2019s flying the plane. The AIR TRAFFIC
    CONTROLLER, BUD, speaks over the radio. BUD This is JFK control tower. Flight
    356, what\u2019s your status? Vanessa presses a button, and the intercom comes
    on. VANESSA This is Vanessa Bloome. I\u2019m a florist from New York. BUD Where\u2019s
    the pilot? VANESSA He\u2019s unconscious and so is the copilot. BUD Not good.
    Is there anyone onboard who has flight experience? A BEAT. BARRY As a matter
    of fact, there is. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 114. BUD Who\u2019s that?
    VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this
    is nothing more than a big metal bee. It\u2019s got giant wings, huge engines.
    VANESSA I can\u2019t fly a plane. BARRY Why not? Isn\u2019t John Travolta a pilot?
    VANESSA Yes? BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we\u2019re
    headed into some lightning. CUT TO: Vanessa shrugs, and takes the controls. SEQ.
    4150 - \u201CBARRY FLIES PLANE\u201D INT. BENSON HOUSE The family is all huddled
    around the TV at the Benson house. ANGLE ON: TV. Bob Bumble is broadcasting.
    BOB BUMBLE This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK airport,
    where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning
    legal victory... \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 115. Adam SPRAYS a can
    of HONEY-WHIP into his mouth. ADAM That\u2019s Barry. BOB BUMBLE ...is now attempting

    EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an
    electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo
    jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater,
    there\u2019s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I\u2019m quite familiar with
    Mr. Benson\u2019s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven\u2019t they done
    enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn\u2019t he your only hope right
    now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn\u2019t be able to fly at all. CUT
    TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are
    too big-- \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold
    on a second. Haven\u2019t we heard this million times? The surface area of the
    wings, and the body mass doesn\u2019t make sense? JEANETTE CHUNG Get this on
    the air. CAMERAMAN You got it! CUT TO: INT. BEE TV CONTROL ROOM An engineer throws
    a switch. BEE ENGINEER Stand by. We\u2019re going live. The \u201CON AIR\u201D

    plays on TV. The pollen jocks are sitting around, playing paddle-ball, Wheel-o,
    and one of them is spinning his helmet on his finger. Buzzwell is in an office
    cubicle, playing computer solitaire. Barry\u2019s family and Adam watch from
    their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV.
    BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making
    honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something
    about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More
    than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\u2019s why I want to get bees back
    to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together.
    That\u2019s the bee way. We\u2019re not made of Jello. We get behind a fellow.

    the plane. The plane takes a sharp dip. VANESSA (CONT\u2019D) Barry, what happened?
    BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot
    that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we\u2019re
    not! VANESSA (V.O.) (folding her arms) Well, then it turns out I cannot fly a

    Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job,
    if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations.
    But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the

    BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn\u2019t know that. ADAM What\u2019s

    Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto
    Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than
    you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s
    just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps,

    one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat,
    and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1
    Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\u2019d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what
    were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
    The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can
    autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON

    off from the main group. They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers.
    Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side
    kid, it\u2019s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry

    BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close?
    BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers
    to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here,
    sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that?
    It\u2019s a little bit of magic, ain\u2019t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates.
    BARRY Wow. That\u2019s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that\u2019s pollen
    power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY
    Cool. The Jock WINKS at Barry. Barry rejoins the other jocks in the sky. They
    swoop in over a pond, kissing the surface. We see their image reflected in the
    water; they\u2019re really moving. They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I\u2019m picking
    up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don\u2019t we need those? SPLITZ

    the immense, yellow globes. SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop
    at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m

    walks back to the service line, BOUNCES the ball. Each time it BOUNCES, the other

    We see Barry and the ball up against the racket as she brings it back. She tosses
    the ball into the air; Barry\u2019s eyes widen. The ball is STRUCK, and the rally

    the g-forces. ANGLE ON: The Pollen Jocks watching Barry pass by them in SLOW

    arcing lob. Ken waits, poised for the return. We see Barry having trouble maneuvering
    the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running
    up. He has a killer look in his eyes. He\u2019s going to hit the ultimate overhead
    smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe you\u2019re
    about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the

    important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our

    whatever they want from us cause we\u2019re the little guys. And what I\u2019m

    smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it!

    is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor,
    it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and
    as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard
    a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these
    ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery
    rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with
    wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd
    shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their
    charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.
    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am
    afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\"

    MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun.
    Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking
    gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams
    the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY
    It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This
    harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
    He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT.
    The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury,
    look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\"
    Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines
    in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the
    white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table.
    The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do?
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the
    species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench.
    It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees!
    ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of
    the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up

    do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table.

    Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong
    to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery
    approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to
    Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the
    balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer

    of fact, there is. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 114. BUD Who\u2019s that?
    VANESSA Barry Benson. BUD From the honey trial? Oh great. BARRY Vanessa, this
    is nothing more than a big metal bee. It\u2019s got giant wings, huge engines.
    VANESSA I can\u2019t fly a plane. BARRY Why not? Isn\u2019t John Travolta a pilot?
    VANESSA Yes? BARRY How hard could it be? VANESSA Wait a minute. Barry, we\u2019re

    BOB BUMBLE This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK airport,
    where a very suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh off his stunning
    legal victory... \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 115. Adam SPRAYS a can

    EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an
    electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo
    jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater,
    there\u2019s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I\u2019m quite familiar with
    Mr. Benson\u2019s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven\u2019t they done
    enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn\u2019t he your only hope right
    now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn\u2019t be able to fly at all. CUT

    their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV.
    BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making
    honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something
    about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More
    than we realized. To us, to everyone. That\u2019s why I want to get bees back
    to doing what we do best. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together.

    Courtroom hub-bub. JUDGE And Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
    Montgomery rises. MONTGOMERY (grumbles, clears his throat) Ladies and gentlemen
    of the jury. My grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed
    it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before
    us. If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think
    of what it would mean. Maybe I would have to negotiate with the silk worm for
    the elastic in my britches. Talking bee. How do we know this isn\u2019t some
    sort of holographic motion picture capture Hollywood wizardry? They could be
    using laser beams, robotics, ventriloquism, cloning...for all we know he could
    be on steroids! Montgomery leers at Barry, who moves to the stand. \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 73. JUDGE Mr. Benson? Barry makes his opening statement.
    BARRY Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, there\u2019s no trickery here. I\u2019m
    just an ordinary bee. And as a bee, honey\u2019s pretty important to me. It\u2019s
    important to all bees. We invented it, we make it, and we protect it with our
    lives. Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take
    whatever they want from us cause we\u2019re the little guys. And what I\u2019m
    hoping is that after this is all over, you\u2019ll see how by taking our honey,
    you\u2019re not only taking away everything we have, but everything we are. ANGLE

    Pretty big company you have there? MR. VANDERHAYDEN I suppose so. BARRY And I
    see you also own HoneyBurton, and Hon-Ron. MR. VANDERHAYDEN Yes. They provide
    beekeepers for our farms. BARRY Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing
    term, I have to say. I don\u2019t imagine you employ any bee free-ers, do you?
    MR. VANDERHAYDEN No. BARRY I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hear you. MR. VANDERHAYDEN
    (louder) No. BARRY No. Because you don\u2019t free bees. You keep bees. And not
    only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar
    of honey? MR. VANDERHAYDEN Well, they\u2019re very lovable creatures. Yogi-bear,
    Fozzy-bear, Build-a-bear. BARRY Yeah, you mean like this?! Vanessa and the SUPERINTENDANT
    from her building ENTER with a GIANT FEROCIOUS GRIZZLY BEAR. He has a neck collar
    and chains extending from either side. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 75.
    By pulling the chains, they bring him directly in front of Vanderhayden. The
    bear LUNGES and ROARS. BARRY (CONT'D) Bears kill bees! How would you like his
    big hairy head crashing into your living room? Biting into your couch, spitting
    out your throwpillows...rowr, rowr! The bear REACTS. BEAR Rowr!! BARRY Okay,
    that\u2019s enough. Take him away. Vanessa and the Superintendant pull the bear
    out of the courtroom. Vanderhayden TREMBLES. The judge GLARES at him. CUT TO:
    INT. COURTROOM- A LITTLE LATER Barry questions STING. BARRY So, Mr. Sting. Thank
    you for being here. Your name intrigues me, I have to say. Where have I heard
    it before? STING I was with a band called \"The Police\". BARRY But you've never
    been a police officer of any kind, have you? STING No, I haven't. \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 76. BARRY No, you haven\u2019t. And so, here we have yet
    another example of bee culture being casually stolen by a human for nothing more
    than a prance-about stage name. STING Oh please. BARRY Have you ever been stung,
    Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say, (looking
    in folder) Mr. Gordon M. Sumner? The jury GASPS. MONTGOMERY (to his aides) That\u2019s
    not his real name? You idiots! CUT TO: INT. COURTHOUSE- LATER BARRY Mr. Liotta,
    first may I offer my belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot
    on E.R. in 2005. LIOTTA Thank you. Thank you. Liotta LAUGHS MANIACALLY. BARRY
    I also see from your resume that you\u2019re devilishly handsome, but with a
    churning inner turmoil that\u2019s always ready to blow. LIOTTA I enjoy what
    I do. Is that a crime? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 77. BARRY Not yet
    it isn\u2019t. But is this what it\u2019s come to for you, Mr. Liotta? Exploiting
    tiny helpless bees so you don\u2019t have to rehearse your part, and learn your
    lines, Sir? LIOTTA Watch it Benson, I could blow right now. BARRY This isn\u2019t
    a goodfella. This is a badfella! LIOTTA (exploding, trying to smash Barry with
    the Emmy) Why doesn\u2019t someone just step on this little creep and we can

    KEN Well hello. VANESSA Oh...Ken. BARRY Hello. VANESSA I didn\u2019t think you
    were coming. KEN No, I was just late. I tried to call. But, (holding his cell
    phone) the battery... VANESSA I didn\u2019t want all this to go to waste, so
    I called Barry. Luckily he was free. BARRY Yeah. KEN (gritting his teeth) Oh,
    that was lucky. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 79. VANESSA Well, there\u2019s
    still a little left. I could heat it up. KEN Yeah, heat it up. Sure, whatever.
    Vanessa EXITS. Ken and Barry look at each other as Barry eats. BARRY So, I hear
    you\u2019re quite a tennis player. I\u2019m not much for the game myself. I find
    the ball a little grabby. KEN That\u2019s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA
    (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that \u201Ceating
    with chopsticks\u201D isn\u2019t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think
    I don\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is
    trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY
    Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud
    out. KEN That\u2019s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table
    knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. \"Bee
    Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
    for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table. BARRY
    I\u2019m going to go drain the old stinger. KEN Yeah, you do that. Barry EXITS
    to the bathroom, grabbing a small piece of a VARIETY MAGAZINE on the way. BARRY
    Oh, look at that. Ken slams the champagne down on the table. Ken closes his eyes
    and buries his face in his hands. He grabs a magazine on the way into the bathroom.

    mind games. BARRY What\u2019s that? KEN Italian Vogue. BARRY Mamma Mia, that\u2019s
    a lot of pages. KEN It\u2019s a lot of ads. BARRY Remember what Van said. Why
    is your life any more valuable than mine? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07

    Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken
    grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT'D) I think something stinks in here.
    He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like
    the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in
    a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside
    the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower,
    pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the
    shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld
    shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the
    drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes
    out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY

    from the vanity (emory board, lipstick, eye curler, etc.) are on the toilet seat.
    Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\u2019re
    bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses
    it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\u2019s surfing. Some water
    splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\u2019s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some
    skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That
    bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except
    for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing?
    KEN You know what? I don\u2019t even like honey! I don\u2019t eat it! VANESSA

    riding on this emotional rollercoaster. VANESSA Goodbye, Ken. KEN Augh! VANESSA
    Whew! Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame. KEN And for your information, I prefer

    Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR.

    Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry\u2019s face) How good? BARRY
    What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn\u2019t about--

    THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM

    downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it.
    BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was
    all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM
    You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right
    into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs

    is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor,
    it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and
    as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard
    a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these
    ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery
    rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with

    shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their
    charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.
    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am
    afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\"

    the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY
    It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This
    harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
    He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT.
    The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury,
    look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\"
    Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines
    in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the
    white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table.
    The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do?
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the

    ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of

    do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table.

    Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong
    to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery
    approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to
    Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the
    balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer

    (answering) Hello? CUT TO: EXT. AIRPLANE ANGLE ON: The underside of the plane.
    The pollen jocks have massed all around the underbelly of the plane, and are
    holding it up. LOU LODUCA Hey Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion
    in there? CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Lou, Buzz, Splitz, and Jackson come up alongside
    the cockpit. BARRY The pollen jocks! VANESSA They do get behind a fellow. BARRY
    Black and yellow. LOU LODUCA (over headset) Hello. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS
    8/13/07 121. Alright you two, what do you say we drop this tin can on the blacktop?
    VANESSA What blacktop? Where? I can\u2019t see anything. Can you? BARRY No, nothing.
    It\u2019s all cloudy. CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY Adam SHOUTS. ADAM Come on, you\u2019ve
    got to think bee, Barry. Thinking bee, thinking bee. ANGLE ON: Overhead shot
    of runway. The bees are in the formation of a flower. In unison they move, causing
    the flower to FLASH YELLOW AND BLACK. BEES (chanting) Thinking bee, thinking
    bee. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT We see through the swirling mist and clouds. A GIANT
    SHAPE OF A FLOWER is forming in the middle of the runway. BARRY Wait a minute.
    I think I\u2019m feeling something. VANESSA What? BARRY I don\u2019t know, but
    it\u2019s strong. And it\u2019s pulling me, like a 27 million year old instinct.
    Bring the nose of the plane down. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 122. LOU

    boys? LOU LODUCA Affirmative. CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 123.
    INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT BARRY Good, good, easy now. Land on that flower! Ready
    boys? Give me full reverse. LOU LODUCA Spin it around! The plane attempts to
    land on top of an \u201CAloha Airlines\u201D plane with flowers painted on it.
    BARRY (V.O) I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions
    of bees! VANESSA Which flower? BARRY That flower! VANESSA I\u2019m aiming at
    the flower! The plane goes after a FAT GUY IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT. BARRY (V.O) That\u2019s
    a fat guy in a flowered shirt! The other other flower! The big one. He snaps
    a photo and runs away. BARRY (CONT'D) Full forward. Ready boys? Nose down. Bring
    your tail up. Rotate around it. VANESSA Oh, this is insane, Barry. BARRY This
    is the only way I know how to fly. CUT TO: \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07
    124. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Am I koo-koo kachoo, or is this plane flying
    in an insect-like pattern? CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY BARRY (V.O) Get your nose in there.
    Don\u2019t be afraid of it. Smell it. Full reverse! Easy, just drop it. Be a
    part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in. Drop it in, woman! The plane
    HOVERS and MANEUVERS, landing in the center of the giant flower, like a bee.
    The FLOWERS from the cargo hold spill out onto the runway. INT. AIPLANE CABIN
    The passengers are motionless for a beat. PASSENGER Come on already! They hear
    the \u201Cding ding\u201D, and all jump up to grab their luggage out of the overheads.

    Barry, we did it. You taught me how to fly. Vanessa raises her hand up for a
    high five. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 125. BARRY Yes. No high five.
    VANESSA Right. ADAM Barry, it worked. Did you see the giant flower? BARRY What
    giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius, man. Genius!
    ADAM Thank you. BARRY But we\u2019re not done yet. Barry flies up to the wing
    of the plane, and addresses the bee crowd. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Listen everyone.
    This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere
    on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We\u2019re the only ones who make
    honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we\u2019re going to survive
    as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be
    bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains? BEES We\u2019re bees! KEYCHAIN
    BEE Keychain! BARRY Then follow me... Except Keychain. BUZZ Hold on Barry. You\u2019ve
    earned this. Buzz puts a pollen jock jacket and helmet with Barry\u2019s name
    on it on Barry. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 126. BARRY I\u2019m a pollen
    jock! (looking at the jacket. The sleeves are a little long) And it\u2019s a
    perfect fit. All I\u2019ve got to do are the sleeves. The Pollen Jocks toss Barry
    a gun. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Oh yeah! ANGLE ON: Martin and Janet Benson. JANET
    BENSON That\u2019s our Barry. All the bees descend upon the flowers on the tarmac,

    a piece of meat. BARRY I had no idea. VANESSA Barry? I\u2019m sorry, have you
    got a moment? BARRY Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate here will be able

    my life! When will this nightmare end? ANDY Let it all go. They don\u2019t break
    stride. ANGLE ON: Camera in front of Barry as he flies out the door and up into
    the sky. Pollen jocks fold in formation behind him as they zoom into the park.
    BARRY (to Splitz) Beautiful day to fly. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07
    130. JACKSON Sure is. BARRY Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that

    if it\u2019s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations.
    But choose carefully, because you\u2019ll stay in the job that you pick for the

    Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Look at that. That\u2019s more pollen than
    you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It\u2019s

    one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat,
    and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1
    Oh my. BARRY I never thought I\u2019d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what
    were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities.
    The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can
    autograph that if you want. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON

    a florist. BARRY Right, right. Barry raises his glass. BARRY (CONT\u2019D) Well,
    here\u2019s to a great team. VANESSA To a great team. They toast. Ken ENTERS
    KEN Well hello. VANESSA Oh...Ken. BARRY Hello. VANESSA I didn\u2019t think you
    were coming. KEN No, I was just late. I tried to call. But, (holding his cell
    phone) the battery... VANESSA I didn\u2019t want all this to go to waste, so
    I called Barry. Luckily he was free. BARRY Yeah. KEN (gritting his teeth) Oh,
    that was lucky. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 79. VANESSA Well, there\u2019s
    still a little left. I could heat it up. KEN Yeah, heat it up. Sure, whatever.
    Vanessa EXITS. Ken and Barry look at each other as Barry eats. BARRY So, I hear
    you\u2019re quite a tennis player. I\u2019m not much for the game myself. I find
    the ball a little grabby. KEN That\u2019s where I usually sit. Right there. VANESSA
    (O.C) Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that \u201Ceating
    with chopsticks\u201D isn\u2019t really a special skill. KEN (to Barry) You think
    I don\u2019t see what you\u2019re doing? BARRY Hey look, I know how hard it is
    trying to find the right job. We certainly have that in common. KEN Do we? BARRY
    Well, bees have 100% employment, of course. But we do jobs like taking the crud
    out. KEN That\u2019s just what I was thinking about doing. Ken holds his table
    knife up. It slips out of his hand. He goes under the table to pick it up. \"Bee
    Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 80. VANESSA Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
    for his fuzz. I hope that was alright. Ken hits his head on the table. BARRY
    I\u2019m going to go drain the old stinger. KEN Yeah, you do that. Barry EXITS
    to the bathroom, grabbing a small piece of a VARIETY MAGAZINE on the way. BARRY
    Oh, look at that. Ken slams the champagne down on the table. Ken closes his eyes
    and buries his face in his hands. He grabs a magazine on the way into the bathroom.
    SEQ. 2800 - \u201CBARRY FIGHTS KEN\u201D INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ken ENTERS,
    closes the door behind him. He\u2019s not happy. Barry is washing his hands.
    He glances back at Ken. KEN You know, I\u2019ve just about had it with your little
    mind games. BARRY What\u2019s that? KEN Italian Vogue. BARRY Mamma Mia, that\u2019s
    a lot of pages. KEN It\u2019s a lot of ads. BARRY Remember what Van said. Why
    is your life any more valuable than mine? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07
    81. KEN It\u2019s funny, I just can\u2019t seem to recall that! Ken WHACKS at
    Barry with the magazine. He misses and KNOCKS EVERYTHING OFF THE VANITY. Ken
    grabs a can of AIR FRESHENER. KEN (CONT'D) I think something stinks in here.
    He sprays at Barry. BARRY I love the smell of flowers. KEN Yeah? How do you like
    the smell of flames? Ken lights the stream. BARRY Not as much. Barry flies in
    a circle. Ken, trying to stay with him, spins in place. ANGLE ON: Flames outside
    the bathroom door. Ken slips on the Italian Vogue, falls backward into the shower,
    pulling down the shower curtain. The can hits him in the head, followed by the
    shower curtain rod, and the rubber duck. Ken reaches back, grabs the handheld
    shower head. He whips around, looking for Barry. ANGLE ON: A WATERBUG near the
    drain. WATERBUG Waterbug. Not taking sides. Barry is on the toilet tank. He comes
    out from behind a shampoo bottle, wearing a chapstick cap as a helmet. BARRY
    Ken, look at me! I\u2019m wearing a chapstick hat. This is pathetic. ANGLE ON:
    Ken turning the hand shower nozzle from \u201CGENTLE\u201D, to \u201CTURBO\u201D,
    to \u201CLETHAL\u201D. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 82. KEN I\u2019ve
    got issues! Ken fires the water at Barry, knocking him into the toilet. The items
    from the vanity (emory board, lipstick, eye curler, etc.) are on the toilet seat.
    Ken looks down at Barry. KEN (CONT'D) Well well well, a royal flush. BARRY You\u2019re
    bluffing. KEN Am I? Ken flushes the toilet. Barry grabs the Emory board and uses
    it to surf. He puts his hand in the water while he\u2019s surfing. Some water
    splashes on Ken. BARRY Surf\u2019s up, dude! KEN Awww, poo water! He does some
    skate board-style half-pipe riding. Barry surfs out of the toilet. BARRY That
    bowl is gnarly. Ken tries to get a shot at him with the toilet brush. KEN Except
    for those dirty yellow rings. Vanessa ENTERS. VANESSA Kenneth! What are you doing?
    KEN You know what? I don\u2019t even like honey! I don\u2019t eat it! VANESSA
    We need to talk! \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 83. She pulls Ken out by

    just a little bee. And he happens to be the nicest bee I\u2019ve met in a long
    time. KEN Long time? What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your
    life? VANESSA No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you\u2019re
    one of them! KEN Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...my nerves are fried from
    riding on this emotional rollercoaster. VANESSA Goodbye, Ken. KEN Augh! VANESSA
    Whew! Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame. KEN And for your information, I prefer
    sugar-free, artificial sweeteners, made by man! He EXITS again. The DOOR SLAMS
    behind him. VANESSA (to Barry) I\u2019m sorry about all that. Ken RE-ENTERS.
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 84. KEN I know it\u2019s got an aftertaste!
    I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between
    Ken and me. (puts his hands in his pockets) I couldn\u2019t overcome it. Oh well.
    VANESSA Are you going to be okay for the trial tomorrow? BARRY Oh, I believe

    see why he\u2019s considered one of the very best lawyers-- Oh. Barry rolls his

    (whispering) Layton, you\u2019ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it\u2019s
    going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, \u201CThe Secret Life of
    Bees\u201D. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently
    whispering) Oh, don\u2019t worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn
    this jury around is to remind them of what they don\u2019t like about bees. (to
    Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR.
    GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery
    approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT\u2019D) Mr. Benson Bee. I\u2019ll ask
    you what I think we\u2019d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship
    to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We\u2019re friends. MONTGOMERY
    Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry\u2019s face) How good? BARRY
    What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn\u2019t about--
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 86. MONTGOMERY Are you her little... (clearing
    throat) ... bed bug? BARRY (flustered) Hey, that\u2019s not the kind of-- MONTGOMERY
    I\u2019ve seen a bee documentary or two. Now, from what I understand, doesn\u2019t

    parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa
    holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry\u2019s parents.
    MONTGOMERY You\u2019re an illegitimate bee, aren\u2019t you Benson? ADAM He\u2019s
    denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They\u2019re agitated.

    He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don\u2019t!
    It\u2019s what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery
    in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I\u2019m hit! Oh, lordy,
    I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery.
    MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled

    legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here\u2019s Don with the 5-day. A
    NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry
    stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is
    on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a
    BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing
    the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn\u2019t I? \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS
    8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is you\u2019re
    alive. You could have died. ADAM I\u2019d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam
    THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM
    (CONT\u2019D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from
    downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there\u2019s a little celery still on it.
    BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can\u2019t explain it. It was
    all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM
    You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I\u2019m sorry. I flew us right
    into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we\u2019re just a couple of bugs
    in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY
    I don\u2019t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\u2019t

    in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT\u2019D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that
    window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don\u2019t
    smoke. Bees don\u2019t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that\u2019s it!
    That\u2019s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It\u2019s

    all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated
    with Gammil, who\u2019s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil\u2019s boat,
    and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where
    is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor,
    it\u2019s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and
    as a result quite often we don\u2019t make very good time. I actually once heard
    a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven\u2019t these
    ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court\u2019s valuable time? Montgomery
    rolls out from behind his table. He\u2019s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with
    wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd
    shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their
    charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses.
    I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am
    afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\u2019s motion. \"Bee Movie\"
    - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can\u2019t. We have a terrific case.
    MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun.
    Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking
    gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams
    the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge\u2019s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY
    It\u2019s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This
    harmless little contraption? This couldn\u2019t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.
    He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT.
    The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury,
    look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or Non?\"
    Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines
    in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the
    white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table.
    The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do?
    \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the
    species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge\u2019s bench.
    It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees!
    ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting \"Free the bees\". JUDGE The court finds in favor of
    the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up
    for a \u201Chigh 5\u201D. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could
    do it. Highfive! She high 5\u2019s Barry, sending him crashing to the table.
    He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I\u2019m okay.
    Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong
    to the bees. Now we won\u2019t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery
    approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to
    Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the
    balance of nature, Benson! You\u2019ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry\u2019s \u2018deer
    in headlights\u2019 expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face.

    102. BARRY Mmmm...you know, I\u2019m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY
    Specifically me. I guess I didn\u2019t think that bees not needing to make honey
    would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it\u2019s not just flowers.
    Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that\u2019s our whole SAT
    test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire
    animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing
    throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there\u2019s no more pollination, it could all
    just go south here, couldn\u2019t it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly
    my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact? VANESSA (not
    sure if he\u2019s joking) How would we do it? BARRY I\u2019ll sting you, you
    step on me. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 103. VANESSA That just kills

    because all the flowers are dying. It\u2019s the last chance I\u2019ll ever have
    to see it. BARRY Vanessa, I just want to say I\u2019m sorry. I never meant it
    to turn out like this. VANESSA I know. Me neither. Vanessa cab drives away. \"Bee

    I know. That\u2019s why this is the last parade. BARRY Maybe not. The cab starts
    pulling ahead of Barry. BARRY (CONT'D) (re: driver) Could you ask him to slow
    down? VANESSA Could you slow down? The cabs slows. Barry flies in the window,
    and lands in the change box, which closes on him. \"Bee Movie\" - JS REVISIONS

    mistake! This is a total disaster, and it\u2019s all my fault! VANESSA Yes, it
    kind of is. BARRY I\u2019ve ruined the planet. And, I wanted to help with your
    flower shop. Instead, I\u2019ve made it worse. VANESSA Actually, it\u2019s completely
    closed down. BARRY Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have
    another idea. And it\u2019s greater than all my previous great ideas combined.
    VANESSA I don\u2019t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry.
    BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. They have
    the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant, and flower bud
    in this park. All we\u2019ve got to do is get what they\u2019ve got back here
